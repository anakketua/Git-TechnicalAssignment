1. git clean is a command that deletes untracked files from a repository's working directory. Untracked files are those in the repo's directory that haven't been added to the repo's index with git add.
2. Run git clean -f if you only want to clean up untracked files. Run git clean -f -d if you wish to remove directories as well.
3. git branch
4. There are two parents for the merging commit. Merge in a hurry You have a straight line of history, but with the recursive merge, it becomes a branch history with numerous lines.
5. git checkout
6. git rm
7. git branch -d git branch -d git branch -d git branch - Only if the branch has already been pushed and merged with the remote branch will the -d option delete it. If you wish to cause the branch to be destroyed even if it hasn't been pushed or merged yet, use -D instead. The branch has been removed from the system.
8. The git diff command shows the differences between two commits' files, or between a commit and your current repository's files. In a file, you can see what text has been added, erased, or altered. The git diff command, by default, shows any uncommitted changes in your repository.
9. git reset
10. Merge conflicts can happen when merging a branch, rebasing a branch, or cherry picking a commit. If Git detects a conflict, it will highlight the conflicted area and ask which code you wish to keep. Once you tell Git which code you want, you can save the file and proceed with the merge, rebase, or cherry pick.
